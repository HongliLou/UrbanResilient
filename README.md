# 🌆 Enhancing Public and Student Understanding of Urban Energy Resilience Through Experiential Climate Education Programs

## 🌱 Project Overview

Urban energy resilience has become a critical issue amid rapid urbanization, climate change, and increasing disruptions from extreme weather events, cyber-attacks, and resource constraints. Traditional approaches to energy management often overlook the interconnected and adaptive nature of urban energy systems, resulting in reduced resilience under dynamic conditions.

This project introduces an integrated methodology combining **advanced modeling**, **real-time adaptation**, and **cross-sector coordination** to enhance urban energy resilience. The core of our work lies in the **Resilience-Aware Urban Energy Framework (RAUEF)** and its operational counterpart, the **Dynamic Adaptive Energy Resilience Strategy (DAERS)**. These frameworks utilize resilience metrics, network theory, and stochastic modeling to simulate, predict, and mitigate potential disruptions effectively.
